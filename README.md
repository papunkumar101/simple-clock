Read the description above, I'm not going to repeat myself here.

Anyways, this is a pretty simple page and doesn't do much.

### Why did I bother adding a search bar?
The only way I found to override the new tab page was via a WebExtension, but,
unfortunately, it appears they do not allow to automatically select the
address bar and clear it, forcing me to **MOVE MY MOUSE***! Pfft! Imagine *that*!

*Moving* my mouse? Forcing* me to ***MOVE*** my mouse after pressing **CTRL+T**
to open a tab? That's too much work!

[\*] Pressing **F6** to select the address bar? **NO!** That's too far away!
